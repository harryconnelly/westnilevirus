## Reality
This project will be the most challenging of the semester so far and is a great introduction to what you will experience working on teams together in you future careers. I wanted to include this short attachement to provide guidance in moving forward.

## High Altitude


This project predicting West Nile risk is spatial AND temporal. It covers a wide physical topography several years with variable seasonal contributions and the target data is really quite sparse making it very difficult to predict outcomes across a wide geographical target envrionment.

So leveraging the creativity within your group is of the utmost importance. Brainstorm early AND often. Talk through ideas outloud. Work near each other whether you are on similar tasks or not.

The goals are clear but not easily attainable. This is the first time you are forced to work in groups and as in the wilderness you do not get to choose them for this project.

## Suggestions
Be prepared to do research. Read white papers journal articles public health websites and epidemiological websites to find ideas for how to approach this project.

FIND OTHER DATA from state federal and local agencies to bolster your predictive capacity and help inform the evolution of the analysis. Think through engineering variables...how can you make this relatively non-predictive variable more useful?

## Presentations

You will need to stick to the intent of this presentation pretty consitently. From the format to the business question to the audience to THE TIME LIMITS...learn to present a full data-driven story in the appropriate time limits. This might mean PRACTICING together as a group.

Consider using a fancy-schmancy visual tool such as Tableau (via Tableau Public) or learning one of the dynamic plotting/ mapping packages in Python to make this project visually extraordinary. Properly tricked out this is a show piece and could be portfolio material.

Everyone in the group must present SOME PORTION of this project during in-class presentations.

## Intellectual Property

You will likely be using outside data ATTRIBUTE IT use citations for all data sets papers websites and sources from which you draw code data or substantial direction in this process.


## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on your groups project your own submission and by peer reviews for the presentations themselves. We will talk about them in your second 1:1 and it is likely I will invite others to this presentation to get you ready for the meet and hire event at the end of the semester.
